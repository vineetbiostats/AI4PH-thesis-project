Background: Clopidogrel is frequently used in patients with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), but its efficacy is hampered by inter-individual variability, due to genetic differences associated with clopidogrel metabolism. We conducted this randomized controlled trial to validate whether the personalized antiplatelet therapy based on clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics leads to better clinical outcomes compared with standard treatment. Methods: Patients were randomly divided into the standard group or pharmacogenetic group, in which the pharmacogenetic group required the detection of the genotyping of CYP2C19*2, CYP2C19*3, and CYP2C19*17. Patients were followed up for 90 days for the primary efficacy endpoint of new stroke events, secondary efficacy endpoint of individual or composite outcomes of the new clinical vascular events, and the incidence of disability. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding. Results: A total of 650 patients underwent randomization, among which 325 were in the pharmacogenomics group while 325 were in the standard group. Our study found after a 90-day follow-up, the risk of stroke and composite vascular events in the pharmacogenomics group was lower than that in the standard group. The incidence of disability significantly decreased in the pharmacogenomics group. In addition, no statistically significant differences were observed in bleeding events between the two groups. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that personalized antiplatelet therapy guided by clopidogrel pharmacogenomics and clinical characteristics can significantly improve the net clinical benefit of ischemic stroke or TIA patients during the 90-day treatment period without increasing bleeding risk.

Introduction: Clopidogrel is the only antiplatelet agent whose activity is significantly affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism.

Areas covered: This review has summarized the available evidence on the clinically significant association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and clopidogrel-based therapy; reviewed the current recommendations for clinical use of CYP2C19 genotype test results in patients on clopidogrel treatment; and discussed possible pitfalls of routine application, and future perspectives of antiplatelets pharmacogenetics.

Expert opinion: The available body of evidence, reflected in several meta-analyses and high-quality clinical practice guidelines, shows that the presence of CYP2C19 LOF alleles, especially CYP2C19*2, correlates with impaired activation of clopidogrel and variable platelet inhibition, followed by minimal or no antiplatelet effect, and higher risk of treatment failure. In combination with other known risk factors, CYP2C19 genetic testing could be very valuable in predicting low clopidogrel efficacy. At the same time, it could be very successful in selecting patients who will most probably benefit from the clopidogrel-based therapy, thus decreasing the pool of those who might need more expensive and otherwise riskier antiplatelet alternatives.

Background: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is recommended in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery (OPCAB). Clopidogrel is less effective among patients with loss-of-function (LoF) of CYP2C19 alleles, while ticagrelor has direct effects on P2Y12 receptor. Whether a CYP2C19 genotype plus platelet aggregation test (PAgT)-guided DAPT after CABG could improve clinical outcomes remain uncertain.

Materials and methods: From August 2019 to December 2020, 1,134 consecutive patients who underwent OPCAB received DAPT for 1 year after surgery in Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine. According to the actual treatment they received in real-world, 382 (33.7%) of them received a traditional DAPT: aspirin 100 mg qd + clopidogrel 75 mg qd, no matter the CYP2C19 genotype and response in platelet aggregation test (PAgT). The other 752 (66.3%) patients received an individual DAPT based on CYP2C19 genotype and PAgT: aspirin 100 mg qd + clopidogrel 75 mg qd if CYP2C19 was extensive metabolizer, or moderate metabolizer but normal response in PAgT; aspirin 100 mg qd + ticagrelor 90 mg bid if CYP2C19 was poor metabolizer, or moderate metabolizer but no or low response in PAgT. One-year follow-up was achieved for all patients. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. The safety outcome was thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) criteria major bleeding.

Results: Compared with the traditional DAPT group, the risk of MACE in the individual DAPT group was significantly lower (5.5 vs. 9.2%, HR 0.583; 95% CI, 0.371-0.915; P = 0.019), mainly due to the decreased risk of MI (1.7 vs. 4.2%, HR 0.407; 95% CI, 0.196-0.846; P = 0.016). The risk of TIMI major bleeding events was similar between the two groups (5.3 vs. 6.0%, RR 0.883; 95% CI, 0.537-1.453; P = 0.626).

Conclusion: For patients who underwent OPCAB, individual DAPT (CYP2C19 genotype plus PAgT-guided strategy) was associated with a lower risk of MACE and a similar risk of major bleeding.

 Background and objective: Genotype data of the Clopidogrel with Aspirin in Acute Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (CHANCE) trial showed that efficacy of clopidogrel aspirin depended on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile. A stratification of patients who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles according to the risk of recurrent stroke may be important for selecting optimal antiplatelet therapy. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor aspirin with clopidogrel aspirin in CYP2C19 LOF carriers with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) stratified by risk profile.

Methods: Data were obtained from Ticagrelor or Clopidogrel with Aspirin in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events II (CHANCE-2) trial. Low-risk and high-risk profiles were defined by Essen Stroke Risk Score (ESRS) (<3 [low risk] and ≥3 [high risk], respectively).

Results: A total of 6,412 CYP2C19 LOF carriers were enrolled; ticagrelor aspirin was associated with a reduced risk of primary outcome (new stroke within 90-day follow-up) in patients at low risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.48-0.82), but not in those at high risk (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73-1.29), compared with clopidogrel aspirin (p = 0.02 for interaction). Secondary outcomes generally went in the same direction as the primary outcome. The primary safety outcome of severe or moderate bleeding did not differ based on risk profile (p = 0.24 for interaction), although the incidence of total bleeding was greater with ticagrelor aspirin than with clopidogrel aspirin among patients at low risk (p < 0.01 for interaction). Analysis in the per-protocol population yielded similar results.

Discussion: This post hoc analysis of CHANCE-2 trial showed that CYP2C19 LOF carriers with minor stroke or TIA at low risk of recurrent stroke received a greater benefit from ticagrelor aspirin than from clopidogrel aspirin.

Classification of evidence: This study provides Class II evidence that CYP2C19 LOF carriers with minor stroke or TIA at low risk, but not at high risk, of recurrent stroke (by the ESRS) received a greater benefit from ticagrelor aspirin than from clopidogrel aspirin. 



Background: Pharmacogenomics (PGx) aims to utilize a patient's genetic data to enable safer and more effective prescribing of medications. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) provides guidelines with strong evidence for 24 genes that affect 72 medications. Despite strong evidence linking PGx alleles to drug response, there is a large gap in the implementation and return of actionable pharmacogenetic findings to patients in standard clinical practice. In this study, we evaluated opportunities for genetically guided medication prescribing in a diverse health system and determined the frequencies of actionable PGx alleles in an ancestrally diverse biobank population.

Methods: A retrospective analysis of the Penn Medicine electronic health records (EHRs), which includes ~ 3.3 million patients between 2012 and 2020, provides a snapshot of the trends in prescriptions for drugs with genotype-based prescribing guidelines ('CPIC level A or B') in the Penn Medicine health system. The Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB) consists of a diverse group of 43,359 participants whose EHRs are linked to genome-wide SNP array and whole exome sequencing (WES) data. We used the Pharmacogenomics Clinical Annotation Tool (PharmCAT), to annotate PGx alleles from PMBB variant call format (VCF) files and identify samples with actionable PGx alleles.

Results: We identified ~ 316.000 unique patients that were prescribed at least 2 drugs with CPIC Level A or B guidelines. Genetic analysis in PMBB identified that 98.9% of participants carry one or more PGx actionable alleles where treatment modification would be recommended. After linking the genetic data with prescription data from the EHR, 14.2% of participants (n = 6157) were prescribed medications that could be impacted by their genotype (as indicated by their PharmCAT report). For example, 856 participants received clopidogrel who carried CYP2C19 reduced function alleles, placing them at increased risk for major adverse cardiovascular events. When we stratified by genetic ancestry, we found disparities in PGx allele frequencies and clinical burden. Clopidogrel users of Asian ancestry in PMBB had significantly higher rates of CYP2C19 actionable alleles than European ancestry users of clopidrogrel (p < 0.0001, OR = 3.68).

Conclusions: Clinically actionable PGx alleles are highly prevalent in our health system and many patients were prescribed medications that could be affected by PGx alleles. These results illustrate the potential utility of preemptive genotyping for tailoring of medications and implementation of PGx into routine clinical care.




Objective: Clopidogrel is widely used for preventing ischemic complications related to cardiovascular diseases. However, many patients experience clopidogrel resistance (CR). The polymorphisms of CYP2C19 have been implicated in CR, but CYP2C19 polymorphism considerably varies with both ethnic group and geographical location. This study aimed to investigate the association between CYP2C19 polymorphisms and clopidogrel resistance (CR) in patients with coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke among Han and Tibetan populations in Qinghai Province, China.

Methods: From June 2019 to January 2020, patients who were diagnosed with coronary heart disease or cerebral infarction in internal medicine of Qinghai Provincial People's Hospital and had taken dual antiplatelet drugs were included in this study. Blood was collected and routine items were completed. Whole exome sequencing was performed for CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19∗2 (rs4244285), CYP2C19∗3 (rs4986893), and CYP2C19∗17 (rs12248560).

Results: A total of 91 patients with coronary heart disease or cerebral infarction (67 Han people (65.99 ± 12.25 years old) and 24 Tibetan (63.6324 Tib years old)) including 52 cases with CR and 39 cases with non-CR were enrolled in this study. For the Han population, the differences in age, glycosylated hemoglobin, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), gender, aspirin resistance, and diabetes were significant between the CR and non-CR groups. For the Tibetan population, the two groups showed no significant difference in all indicators. There was no significant difference between CR and non-CR groups for all genotypes (CYP2C19 ∗2, ∗3, and ∗17) in either Han or Tibetan populations. For the Han populations, age, APTT, and aspirin resistance were significantly correlated with CR.

Conclusion: The present study indicated that CYP2C19∗2, CYP2C19∗3, and CYP2C19∗17 alleles were not correlated with CR for both Han and Tibetan populations in Qinghai Province, while age, APTT, and aspirin resistance were independent risk factors of CR in this region.



Aim: In this study, we investigated the association between ABCC2 polymorphism and clopidogrel response as well as the associated hypothetical mechanism. Methods: Chinese patients (213) with coronary artery disease (CAD) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received clopidogrel were recruited. Thereafter, their ADP-induced platelet inhibition rates (PAIR%) were determined via thromboelastometry. Further, the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCC2 were genotyped using high-resolution melting curve (HRM)-PCR, while CYP2C19*2 and *3 polymorphisms were genotyped via real-time PCR. Results: The allele frequencies of ABCC2 rs717620 were 74.88 and 25.12% for the C and T alleles, respectively. Further, ABCC2 rs717620 TT carriers exhibited significantly higher PAIR% values (72.60 ± 27.69) than both CT (61.44 ± 23.65) and CC carriers (52.72 ± 21.99) (p = 0.047 and p = 0.001, respectively), and ABCC2 rs717620 CT carriers showed significantly higher mean PAIR% values than ABCC2 rs717620 CC carriers (p = 0.011). However, the PAIR% values corresponding to ABCC2 rs2273697 and ABCC2 rs3740066 carriers were not different. Additionally, CYP2C19*2 AA carriers presented significantly lower PAIR% values than CYP2C19*2 GA (p = 0.015) and GG (p = 0.003) carriers, and CYP2C19*3 GA carriers also presented significantly lower PAIR% values than CYP2C19*3 GG carriers (p = 0.041). In patients with CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EM), ABCC2 rs717620 TT carriers showed significantly higher PAIR% values (89.77 ± 9.73) than CT (76.76 ± 26.00) and CC carriers (74.09 ± 25.29) (p = 0.040 and p = 0.009, respectively). In patients with CYP2C19 poor metabolizers (PM), ABCC2 rs717620 CC carriers showed significantly lower PAIR% values (51.72 ± 25.78) than CT carriers (75.37 ± 23.57) (p = 0.043). Furthermore, after adjusting for confounding factors, ABCC2 rs717620 was identified as a strong predictor of clopidogrel hyperreactivity. Conclusion: We proposed a new target, ABCC2 rs717620, in the efflux pathway that affects individual responses to clopidogrel. The TT allele of ABCC2 rs717620 was also identified as an independent risk factor for clopidogrel hyperreactivity, and CYP2C19*2 and *3 showed association with an increased risk for clopidogrel resistance. Additionally, ABCC2 rs717620 may affect individual responses to clopidogrel via post-transcriptional regulation and interaction with CYP2C19. These findings provide new insights that may guide the accurate use of clopidogrel.

Background: Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing has proved its utility and cost-effectiveness for some commonly prescribed cardiovascular disease (CVD) medications. In addition, PGx-guided dosing guidelines are now available for multiple CVD drugs, including clopidogrel, warfarin, and statins. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) population is diverse and multiethnic, with over 150 nationalities residing in the country. PGx-testing is not part of the standard of care in most global healthcare settings, including the UAE healthcare system. The first pharmacogenomic implementation clinical study in CVD has been approved recently, but multiple considerations needed evaluation before commencing. The current report appraises the PGx-clinical implementation procedure and the potential benefits of pursuing PGx-implementation initiatives in the UAE with global implications.

Methods: Patients prescribed one or more of the following drugs: clopidogrel, atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, and warfarin, were recruited. Genotyping selected genetic variants at genes interacting with the study drugs was performed by real-time PCR.

Results: For the current pilot study, 160 patients were recruited. The genotypes and inferred haplotypes, diplotypes, and predicted phenotypes revealed that 11.9% of the participants were poor CYP2C19 metabolizers, 35% intermediate metabolizers, 28.1% normal metabolizers, and 25% rapid or ultrarapid metabolizers. Notably, 46.9% of our cohort should receive a recommendation to avoid using clopidogrel or consider an alternative medication. Regarding warfarin, only 20% of the participants exhibited reference alleles at VKORC1-1639G &gt; A, CYP2C9*2, and CYP2C9*3, leaving 80% with alternative genotypes at any of the two genes that can be integrated into the warfarin dosing algorithms and can be used whenever the patient receives a warfarin prescription. For statins, 31.5% of patients carried at least one allele at the genotyped SLCO1B1 variant (rs4149056), increasing their risk of developing myopathy. 96% of our cohort received at least one PGx-generated clinical recommendation for the studied drugs.

Conclusion: The current pilot analysis verified the feasibility of PGx-testing and the unforeseen high frequencies of patients currently treated with suboptimal drug regimens, which may potentially benefit from PGx testing.

Background: The CYP2C19 gene is highly polymorphic, and CYP2C19 is involved in the broad interindividual variability of the clinical efficacy of certain clinical medications, such as clopidogrel. However, data on the CYP2C19 genotype in the Chinese population of the Foshan area of Guangdong Province are scarce. The purpose of this study was to determine CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms in patients in the Foshan area and to compare the CYP2C19 genotype frequencies in different populations to determine the allele distribution pattern to identify the most appropriate prescription.

Methods: The CYP2C19 gene was detected in 1231 patients on a gene chip platform, and the genotype frequencies of CYP2C19 in Foshan populations from different populations were compared.

Results: The frequencies of CYP2C19*1, *2 and *3 in the Foshan population were 63.89%, 30.46% and 5.65%, respectively. For the three metabolic types, the frequency associated with the rapid metabolism type (*1/*1) was 41.51 [95% confidence interval (CI) 40.11 to 42.91%]; that for the intermediate metabolism type (*1/*2, *1/*3) was 44.76% (95% CI 43.34 to 46.18) and that for the slow metabolism type (*2/*2, *2/*3, *3/*3) was 13.73% (95% CI 12.75 to 14.71%). In the Foshan population, the frequencies of the CYP2C19 *2 and *3 alleles were similar to those previously reported for Chinese and other Asian populations.

Conclusion: Our study is a report on the genetic basis of CYP2C19 polymorphism in the Foshan population. Our results will potentially contribute to the improvement of pharmacotherapy effectiveness by providing personalized medicine for the Foshan population.

Objective: It remains unclear when sufficient antiplatelet effect is achieved after administration of a loading dose of clopidogrel in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS). This study aimed to evaluate the clopidogrel response in patients with AIS identified by the platelet function test (PFT).

Methods: P2Y12 reaction unit (PRU) values measured using VerifyNow at baseline and at 6, 24, and 72 h after administration of a loading dose (300 mg) of clopidogrel were compared between patients with AIS and those of other cerebrovascular diseases (CVD). The prevalence of clopidogrel abnormal response and its associated factors were examined.

Results: The PRU value was significantly reduced with time in the other CVD group (p < 0.0001), and also in the AIS group (p = 0.0073). The PRU values were significantly higher in the AIS group than in the other CVD group (p < 0.0001 between the groups, baseline: 314 ± 53 vs. 284 ± 62, p = 0.35; 6 h: 290 ± 66 vs. 214 ± 71, p = 0.016; 24 h: 270 ± 75 vs. 190 ± 70, p < 0.0001; and 72 h: 231 ± 76 vs. 163 ± 93, p = 0.105). The prevalence of clopidogrel hypo-responder (PRU > 240 at 24 h after administration) was higher in the AIS group (79 vs. 33%, p < 0.0001) and associated with the baseline PRU value but not with the cytochrome P450 2C19 genotype or clinical ischemic events.

Conclusions: Residual platelet reactivity at 24 h after clopidogrel loading was substantially higher in patients with AIS than in patients with other CVD. In addition, most patients with AIS were judged to be hypo-responders on PFT. This should be carefully interpreted in patients with AIS because of poor specificity for predicting clinical ischemic events.

Background: CYP2C19 genetic variation and clinical factors have been proved to be related with clopidogrel resistance (CR) in adults, while the presence of CR in children with Kawasaki disease (KD) was seldom reported. Our objective was to evaluate KD patients' response to clopidogrel treatment and determine whether CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms and laboratory indicators are associated with CR in this population.

Methods: This was a prospective and single-center study. We recruited children with KD hospitalized in the cardiology department at the Children's Hospital Capital Institute of Pediatrics between January 2019 and October 2021, and the distribution of the CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms was assessed. According to the light transmission aggregometry (LTA) test results, KD patients who were treated with clopidogrel were divided into CR group and non-CR (NCR) group. We also analyzed the influence of CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms and laboratory indicators on CR in children with KD.

Results: (1) A total of 346 children with KD were evaluated for the genotypic and phenotypic distributions of CYP2C19. Loss-of-function (LOF) mutated allele was included in 56.9% of CYP2C19 genotypes, and their corresponding phenotypes were intermediate metabolizers (46.2%) and poor metabolizers (10.7%). (2) The incidence of CR in this study population was 31.4%. The multivariate logistic regression showed that carrying CYP2C19 LOF allele (OR, 3.922; 95%CI, 1.504-10.282; P = 0.005) and high levels of low-density lipoprotein (OR, 1.675; 95%CI, 1.069-2.623; P = 0.024) were independent risk factor for CR, while low levels of high-density lipoprotein (OR, 0.120; 95%CI, 0.020, 0.734; P = 0.022) was an independent protective factor for CR. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of the multivariate logistic regression model (including high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and CYP2C19 LOF allele carriers) for predicting CR was 0.769 (95% CI, 0.674-0.863; P < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 70.3 and 74.0%, respectively.

Conclusion: Carrying CYP2C19 LOF allele, low levels of high-density lipoprotein, and high levels of low-density lipoprotein were independent risk factors for CR in children with KD in China. This may benefit pediatricians in choosing appropriate individualized antiplatelet therapy.

Background: Clopidogrel is recommended in international guidelines to prevent arterial thrombotic events in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Clopidogrel itself is inactive and metabolism is dependent on the CYP2C19 enzyme. About 30% of Caucasian PAD patients receiving clopidogrel carry 1 or 2 CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele(s) and do not or to a limited extent convert the prodrug into its active metabolite. As a result, platelet inhibition may be inadequate which could lead to an increased risk of adverse clinical events related to arterial thrombosis. A CYP2C19 genotype-guided antithrombotic treatment might be beneficial for PAD patients.

Methods: GENPAD is a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving 2,276 PAD patients with an indication for clopidogrel monotherapy. Patients with a separate indication for dual antiplatelet therapy or stronger antithrombotic therapy are not eligible for study participation. Patients randomized to the control group will receive clopidogrel 75 mg once daily without pharmacogenetic guidance. Patients randomized to the intervention group will be tested for carriage of CYP2C19 *2 and *3 loss-of-function alleles, followed by a genotype-guided antithrombotic treatment with either clopidogrel 75 mg once daily for normal metabolizers, clopidogrel 150 mg once daily for intermediate metabolizers, or acetylsalicylic acid 80 mg once daily plus rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily for poor metabolizers. The primary outcome is a composite of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, cardiovascular death, acute or chronic limb ischemia, peripheral vascular interventions, or death. The secondary outcomes are the individual elements of the primary composite outcome and clinically relevant bleeding complications.

Conclusion: The aim of the GENPAD study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of a genotype-guided antithrombotic treatment strategy compared to conventional clopidogrel treatment in PAD patients.



Background Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) rs956115 is associated with vascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease and concomitant diabetes. CYP2C19*2 (rs4244285) modulates clopidogrel response and predicts the outcome of coronary artery disease. This study was designed to explore the association between IRS-1, CYP2C19*2 genotypes, platelet reactivity, and 1-year outcome in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods and Results Genotyping was performed using an improved multiplex ligation detection reaction technique. Platelet aggregation was assessed by light transmission aggregometry. Major adverse cardiovascular events were defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and ischemic stroke. A total of 2213 consecutive patients were screened and 1614 were recruited. At 1 month, patients with IRS-1 CG genotype had significantly lower levels of ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with CC homozygotes. Patients with IRS-1 CG or GG genotype had a 2.09-fold higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with those with CC homozygotes (95% CI, 1.04-4.19; P=0.0376). By comparison, patients with CYP2C19*2 GA or AA genotype had higher ADP-induced platelet aggregation compared with patients with GG homozygotes. Although there was no significant difference in risk of major adverse cardiovascular events between patients with GA/AA and GG genotypes, patients with GA genotype had a 2.19-fold higher risk than those with GG homozygotes (95% CI, 1.13-4.24; P=0.0200). No interaction between IRS-1 and CYP2C19*2 genotypes was observed. Conclusions In patients following percutaneous coronary intervention, IRS-1 GG/CG and CYP2C19*2 GA genotypes were associated with 2.09- and 2.19-fold increased cardiovascular risk, respectively, at 1-year follow-up. The association between IRS-1 genotypes and major adverse cardiovascular events appeared to be independent of known clinical predictors.

Introduction: Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet agent recommended for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke (IS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite by hepatic cytochrome P450-2C19 (CYP2C19) is essential for the inhibition of the P2Y12 receptor and subsequent platelet aggregation to prevent thrombotic events. CYP2C19 is highly polymorphic, with over 30 loss of function (LoF) alleles. This review considers whether there is sufficient data to support genotype guided antiplatelet therapy after stroke.

Areas covered: A systematic literature review retrieved articles, which describe the interaction between CYP2C19 genotype and clinical outcomes following IS or TIA when treated with clopidogrel. The review documents efforts to identify optimal antiplatelet regimens and explores the value genotype guided antiplatelet therapy. The work outlines the contemporary understanding of clopidogrel metabolism and appraises evidence linking CYP2C19 LoF variants with attenuated platelet inhibition and poorer outcomes.

Expert opinion: There is good evidence that CYP2C19 LoF allele carriers of Han-Chinese ancestry have increased risk for further vascular events following TIA or IS when treated with clopidogrel. The evidence base is less certain in other populations. The expansion of pharmacogenetics into routine clinical practice will facilitate further research and help tailor other aspects of secondary prevention.

To investigate the relationship between plasma microRNA-223 expression and platelet reactivity in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to evaluate its predictive value in clopidogrel resistance or high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR). A total of 120 patients with acute ischemic stroke were screened in this study, and 60 patients were included in the acute ischemic stroke group according to the inclusion criteria and platelet reactivity after clopidogrel treatment. control group was 60 non-ischemic stroke patients hospitalized. The levels of phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation (ADP-PAg) in platelets were detected by flow cytometry. The expression level of plasma microRNA-223 was detected before and after clopidogrel treatment using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PcR). The AIS group was then divided into the clopidogrel non-HTPR and the clopidogrel HTPR groups based on the relative inhibition rate. We found that: 1) the VASP platelet reactivity index (PRI) was positively correlated with ADP-PAg; 2) before administration, the plasma microRNA-223 expression level and VASP-PRI were higher in the AIS group than in the control group; 3) after administration, the expression level of microRNA-223 was negatively correlated with VASP-PRI; 4) before and after treatment, the plasma microRNA-223 expression level in the clopidogrel HTPR group was lower than in the non-AIS patients; 5) before treatment, there was an interaction between the expression level of microRNA-223 in the plasma and the cYP2c19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele. The study showed that decreased plasma microRNA-223 expression levels in AIS patients indicate an increased risk of clopidogrel HTPR. carrying cYP2c19 LOF alleles may result in the microRNA-223 expression being more distinct. The combined detection of plasma microRNA-223 and cYP2c19 gene polymorphisms may be effective in predicting the occurrence of clopidogrel HTPR in patients with AIS. 

 Background and purpose: Previous studies demonstrated that discontinuation of clopidogrel in patients after ACS was associated with a rebound increase in risk of recurrent events. In this study, we aimed to investigate the rebound effect after discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy in patients with TIA or stroke.

Methods: All patients with minor stroke or TIA were recruited from the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events (CHANCE) trial. Patients were divided into two groups: patients who discontinued clopidogrel and switched to aspirin therapy (Clopidogrel Discontinuation Group) and patients who continued one mono-antiplatelet therapy (non-Clopidogrel Discontinuation Group) during 90-180 days. The outcomes included risks of recurrent ischemic stroke, recurrent TIA, and composite events during 90-180 days. The prevalence of each outcome was compared between two groups for every 30 days. Further subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with and without CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles.

Results: Among the 3456 patients included, a total of 10 patients in the Clopidogrel Discontinuation Group and 11 patients in the non-Clopidogrel Discontinuation Group presented ischemic stroke recurrence during the 90-180-day period. The inter-group comparisons were not significant in each 30 days. Similar results were found for recurrent stroke, recurrent TIA, and composite events in these two groups, which were also found in CYP2C19 subgroup analysis.

Conclusions: No rebound increase in the risk of ischemic stroke and composite events was found during the 90 days after discontinuation of clopidogrel therapy in patients with TIA or minor stroke in the CHANCE trial. 

 Background: Hypertension is a risk factor of poor stroke outcomes and associated with antiplatelet resistance. This study aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor-aspirin versus clopidogrel-aspirin in patients with different hypertension status, using randomized trial data from the CHANCE-2 trial (Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients With Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events-II).

Methods: A total of 6412 patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack who carried CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles were enrolled and randomized to either ticagrelor-aspirin or clopidogrel-aspirin group. Hypertension status were classified into no, newly diagnosed, and previously diagnosed hypertension according to medical history, blood pressure, and antihypertensive medications during hospitalization. The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were stroke recurrence and moderate to severe bleeding risk within 90-day follow-up.

Results: Ticagrelor-aspirin was associated with reduced risk of new stroke in patients without hypertension (32 [4.8%] versus 60 [7.2%]; hazard ratio, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.35-0.86]), but not in those with a newly diagnosed hypertension (20 [5.3%] versus 36 [9.1%]; hazard ratio 0.59 [95% CI, 0.33-1.07]), or those with a previously diagnosed hypertension (139 [7.0%] versus 147 [7.4%]; hazard ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.74-1.18]) compared with clopidogrel-aspirin (P=0.04 for interaction). The risk of bleeding for ticagrelor-aspirin was not associated with hypertension status (0.1% versus 0.4%; 0.3% versus 0.5%, 0.4% versus 0.3%, P=0.50 for interaction). All the efficacy and safety outcomes between treatments did not differ by blood pressure levels on admission.

Conclusions: In the CHANCE-2 trial, patients without hypertension received a significantly greater benefit from ticagrelor- aspirin than those with previous hypertension after minor stroke or transient ischemic attack, and a similar benefit trend was observed in those with newly diagnosed hypertension. 



Clopidogrel is a purinergic receptor P2Y12 (P2RY12)-blocking pro-drug used to inhibit platelet aggregation in patients at risk for major adverse cardiac events (MACE), such as coronary artery disease and stroke. Despite clopidogrel therapy, some patients may still present with recurrent cardiovascular events. One possible cause of recurrence are variants in the cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) gene. CYP2C19 is responsible for the metabolism of many drugs including clopidogrel. Recent studies have associated pharmacogenetics testing of CYP2C19 variants to guide clopidogrel therapy with a decreased risk of certain recurrent MACEs. Through a different mechanism, diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity are also associated with clopidogrel treatment failure. We describe the case of a 64-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and DM/obesity, who presented to University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) in 2019 with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) while on clopidogrel/aspirin dual anti-platelet therapy. After CYP2C19 genetic testing revealed that she was an intermediate metabolizer with a heterozygous *2 genotype, ticagrelor replaced the clopidogrel treatment regimen. No future MACEs were documented in the two-year patient follow-up. Thus, ACS patients with DM/obesity who have undergone PCI and are intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers may yield better treatment outcomes if prescribed ticagrelor instead of clopidogrel. Whether this improvement was due to genotype-guided therapy or the differing interactions of clopidogrel/ticagrelor in DM/obese patients is unknown based on available data. Regardless, CYP2C19 genotype-guided treatment of ACS/PCI patients, with consideration of DM/obesity status, may provide effective individualized therapy compared to standard treatment. The inclusion of DM/obesity in this study is clinically relevant because DM/obesity has become a major health issue in the United States and worldwide.

This study aimed to investigate the possible influence of genetic and non-genetic factors on the incidence of clopidogrel adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in cardiology patients, including the most important CYP2C19 alleles, namely *2 and *17, as well as compliance, dose, drug interactions, and clinical factors. A total of 102 clopidogrel-treated adult Caucasian patients hospitalized at the Cardiology Department of the Clinical Center of Montenegro were enrolled in the study. Data on clinical outcomes of interest were obtained by intensive monitoring ADRs during hospitalization and one year after hospital discharge. Genotyping for CYP2C19*2 and *17 was conducted using the real-time polymerase chain reaction method. ADRs were characterized using the Rawlins and Thompson classification and the World Health Organization criteria. Causality was assessed using the Naranjo probability scale. ADRs to clopidogrel were observed in 9 of 102 patients (8.8%). The observed frequencies of CYP2C19*2 and *17 were 13.2 and 25.5%, respectively. Our study, which is the first to report the frequency of CYP2C19 polymorphism in the Montenegrin population, as well as to link the pharmacovigilance of clopidogrel with CYP2C19 gene variability, shows that the incidence of ADRs of clopidogrel in cardiac patients is high and depends on CYP2C19 polymorphisms, comedication/drug interactions, and gastrointestinal comorbidity.

Aims: Vicagrel, a novel antiplatelet prodrug to overcome the residual high platelet reactivity of clopidogrel induced by inactive metabolism and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19 polymorphisms, provides favourable antiplatelet inhibition in healthy volunteers. However, its antiplatelet effect and safety in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) are unclear.

Methods and results: This was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, triple-dummy, dose-exploring phase II trial comparing the antiplatelet activity and safety of vicagrel at different doses vs. those of clopidogrel in patients with CAD undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The primary endpoint was inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation (%IPA) after loading and maintenance doses (LD/MD) at 28 days. Safety endpoints included adverse events (AEs) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium-defined any bleeding. Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and the influence of CYP2C19 polymorphisms were explored in subgroup analysis. Two hundred and seventy-nine patients diagnosed with stable CAD (51.97%), unstable angina (40.86%), and myocardial infarction (7.17%) were randomized to receive vicagrel 20/5 mg (LD/MD), 24/6 mg, or 30/7.5 mg or clopidogrel 300/75 mg in combination with aspirin. %IPAs on Day 28 were 30.19%, 35.02%, 45.61%, and 32.55% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, respectively, and were comparable across all groups (P = 0.0694). The plasma concentration of the vicagrel active metabolite M15-2 had a similar area under curve and Tmax to those of clopidogrel. There were no significant differences in AEs (4.35%, 0%, 1.45%, and 5.56% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, P = 0.6667) or any bleeding (13.04%, 14.06%, 11.59%, and 11.11% for vicagrel 20/5, 24/6, and 30/7.5 mg and clopidogrel, respectively, P = 0.95) across four groups. %IPAs and PK profiles of vicagrel did not vary significantly among different CYP2C19 metabolizers.

Conclusion: Vicagrel had comparable antiplatelet effect and safety to clopidogrel in patients with CAD undergoing PCI.

What is known and objective: For patients after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), clopidogrel combined with aspirin is a conventional dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) method. Because the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 gene leads to clopidogrel resistance, guidelines for antiplatelet recommendations in CYP2C19 of ultrarapid metabolizers (UM), extended metabolizers (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM) are clear. However, there is no clear recommendation as to whether ticagrelor or double dose clopidogrel is the best antiplatelet regimen for CYP2C19 of intermediate metabolizers (IM). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor (combined with aspirin) and high-dose clopidogrel (combined with aspirin) in patients after PCI with CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) alleles.

Methods: We searched the following databases to select RCTs of comparing ticagrelor with high-dose clopidogrel in patients after PCI with CYP2C19 LOF alleles: CNKI, Wanfang Data, PubMed, Clinical trials, Cochrane, Web of Science and Embase. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), platelet function and TIMI bleeding event were defined as the outcomes. revman 5.3 software was used to perform meta-analysis.

Results and discussion: A total of 14 RCTs with 2351 patients were enrolled. Meta-analysis showed that compared with high-dose clopidogrel, ticagrelor had reduced incidence of MACEs (OR = 0.32, 95% Cl: 0.23-0.44, p < 0.00001), stent thrombosis (OR: 0.24, 95%CI: 0.13-0.44, p < 0.00001), myocardial infarction OR: 0.42, 95%CI: 0.22-0.80, p = 0.008), revascularization (OR: 0.29, 95%CI: 0.10-0.82, p = 0.02) and unstable angina (OR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.29-0.77, p = 0.003) in patients after PCI with CYP2C19 LOF alleles. A subgroup analysis showed that ticagrelor reduced the risk of MACEs compared with high-dose clopidogrel regardless of the type of metabolizer. Compared with high-dose clopidogrel, ticagrelor significantly reduced the risk of MACE with longer follow-up period (more than 3 months) without increasing the risk of bleeding (OR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.53-1.49, p = 0.30), while elevated dyspnoea (OR: 5.62, 95%CI: 3.07-10.28, p < 0.00001).

What is new and conclusions: For patients carrying CYP2C19 LOF alleles after PCI, ticagrelor may be better than high-dose clopidogrel in reducing the risk of MACEs, while dyspnoea incidents should be alerted.

Objectives: To mitigate the incidence of recurrent stroke in patients, dual antiplatelet therapy comprising aspirin and clopidogrel is usually administered. Clopidogrel is a prodrug and its bioactivation is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C19. The main objective of this work was to determine the prevalence of CYP2C19*2 carriers in Saudi ischemic stroke patients and assess the suitability of using genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy in a university hospital setup.

Methods: This prospective (2018-2019) study was conducted on 256 patients (age 61 ± 12.5) clinically diagnosed with ischemic stroke who were genotyped using Spartan RX CYP2C19 assay.

Results: From the total patient group (256), upon admission, 210 patients were prescribed either aspirin, clopidogrel or dual antiplatelet therapy. Of the 27 patients with the CYP2C19*2 allele who were prescribed clopidogrel (18) or dual antiplatelet therapy (9), only 21 patients could be followed up for a period of six months post stroke event, in addition to 21 age- and sex-matched patients with the normal allele. The CYP2C19*2 allele carriers had a statistically significant increased risk of recurrent stroke compared to patients carrying the normal allele.

Conclusions: This study shows the suitability of using genotyping to guide antiplatelet therapy in ischemic stroke patients in a clinical setting.

Background: Studies show inconsistent results regarding the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on the pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical outcomes of ticagrelor. With the implementation of genotype-guided individualized antiplatelet therapy, the association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor for patients is still worthy of exploring and studying.

Methods: This systematic review protocol has been registered in the PROSPERO network (No. CRD 42020158920). Electronic databases of PubMed, EmBase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to January 6th, 2022 to select studies investigating the impact of CYP2C19 genotype on PD and clinical outcomes of ticagrelor. The results were presented as odds ratio (OR) or weight mean difference with its 95% confidence interval (CI) by using the random-effects model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was used to control risk of random errors and detect the robustness of outcomes.

Results: Eight studies recruited a total of 6405 patients treated with ticagrelor. Mostly trials reported no significant effect of any or no CYP2C19 loss-of-function (LOF) allele (*2 or *3) on all the endpoints. Compared with no LOF allele carriers, subgroup analysis suggested any LOF allele in Asian patients was associated with a significant decreased risk of bleeding events (OR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.22-0.75; P = 0.004). Furthermore, any LOF allele carriers didn't yield any impact on the risk of MACEs (OR: 1.11; 95% CI: 0.76-1.64; P = 0.586), stroke (OR: 1.71; 95% CI: 0.99-2.96; P = 0.054), definite stent thrombosis (OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.17-4.60; P = 0.882), bleeding (OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.27-1.46; P = 0.281), myocardial infarction (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.30-2.20; P = 0.682), and revascularization (OR: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.33-2.00; P = 0.649) in all patients. The results of TSA were indicated that more further trials would be required.

Conclusions: This qualitative and quantitative study suggested Asian patients carrying any CYP2C19 LOF allele might have a lower risk of bleeding events comparing with no LOF allele carriers when treated with ticagrelor. However, we did not prove an important role of CYP2C19 genotype on the risk of PD and clinical endpoints in the whole cohort. In future, more large-scale prospective studies and more different ethnic populations should be included.

Introduction: Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin in combination with a P2Y12 receptor antagonist is a cornerstone for treating patients with acute coronary syndrome and in percutaneous coronary intervention. However, as this combination of antiplatelet therapy increases the risk of bleeding, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are currently recommended to prevent gastrointestinal ulcers and bleeding. The cytochrome P450 (CYP450) isoenzyme system metabolizes both clopidogrel (CLP) and PPIs. Unfortunately, omeprazole (OM) reduce the antiplatelet activity of CLP and increases the probability of recurrence of cardiovascular events by competitively inhibiting the CYP450 isoenzyme CYP2C19.

Methods: To address these abovementioned problems, we designed and synthesized deuterium CLP (D-CL) using selective deuterium technology. Our previous research results showed that D-CL had better pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Thus, the HPLC-MS/MS method, cocktail method, Born method, electro-stimulated thrombus generation, and thrombus elastography were used to detect the production of thiol active metabolites (AM), CYP450 enzyme activities, platelet aggregation, time and length of thrombus formation, and the maximum clot strength after combination therapy. We investigated the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics properties of D-CL combined with OM.

Results: As compared to CLP, D-CL was less affected when combined with OM, which was reflected in lower inhibitory effects of CYP450 enzyme activities, a greater area under the curve of AM, and better antiplatelet and antithrombotic effects.

Conclusion: D-CL may reduce drug-drug interactions and address the clinical disadvantages of CLP.
